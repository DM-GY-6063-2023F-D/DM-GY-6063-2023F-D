### Course Description

This course is an introductory programming class, appropriate for students with no prior programming experience. Traditionally, introductory programming teaches algorithmic problem-solving, where a sequence of instructions describe the steps necessary to achieve a desired result. In this course, students are asked to go beyond this sequential thinking and to think concurrently, modularly and critically about the creative potential of software. By its end, students are empowered to write and read code for event-driven, object-oriented, graphical user interfaces like websites, interactive installations, games aand others.

### Course Objectives

Students in this course will:

- Learn the basics of programming and creative coding using Javascript and the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library.
- Apply their understanding of digital media to software.
- Make connections between larger social experiences/issues and the process of software development.
- Learn best practices for designing software within an event-driven, object-oriented, real time framework.
- Experiment with different techniques for data processing and user input/output.
- Propose and develop a complete software experience as a final project.

### Pre-requisites

None.

### An Outline of the Course

### Assignments, Projects, etc

### Grading

### Attendance

You are expected to attend all class sessions. Absences due to non-emergency situations will only be cleared if you let me know a week or more in advance, and even then only for compelling personal or professional reasons (e.g., attending an important conference, going to a wedding). If you're unable to attend class due to contagious or incapacitating illness, please let me know by e-mail or slack before class begins.

Each unexcused absence will deduct 5% from your final grade. If you have three or more unexcused absences, you risk failing the course.

### Lateness

Be on time to class. If you're more than fifteen minutes late, or if you leave early without letting me know ahead of time, it will count as an unexcused absence.

### Tech Etiquette

You're welcome to use laptops/devices in class to take notes, work on exercises and look up references, but be mindful of other students and close laptops/devices during presentations and discussions. For context: 
[Why I Just Asked My Students To Put Their Laptops Away](https://medium.com/@cshirky/why-i-just-asked-my-students-to-put-their-laptops-away-7f5f7c50f368).

### Social Etiquette

These [Social Rules from The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules) should be kept in mind during class discussions, presentations, critiques:
- [No well-actually’s](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules#no-well-actuallys)
- [No feigned surprise](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules#no-feigning-surprise)
- [No backseat driving](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules#no-backseat-driving)
- [No subtle -isms](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules#no-subtle-isms)

Also, these observations from a [discussion about bots](https://www.crummy.com/2013/11/27/0) is a helpful reminder:

*"There is a general rule for comedy and art: always punch up, never punch down. We let comedians and artists and miscellaneous jesters do outrageous things as long as they obey this rule. You can poke fun at yourself, you can make a joke at the expense of someone with higher social status than you, but if you mock someone with lower status, it's not cool."*

*"If you make a joke, and people get really offended, it's almost certainly because you violated this rule. People don't get offended randomly. Explaining that 'it was just a joke' doesn't help; everyone knows what a joke is. The problem is that you used a joke as a means of being an asshole."*

Be sensitive to what your classmates might find offensive, triggering or violent and be graceful and listen carefully when your work gets called out.

### Inclusion

The NYU Tandon School values an inclusive and equitable environment for all our students. I hope to foster a sense of community in this class and consider it a place where individuals of all backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, national origins, gender identities, sexual orientations, religious, political affiliations and abilities will be treated with respect. It is my intent that all students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. If this standard is not being upheld, please feel free to speak with me.


### Academic Integrity

Violations of academic integrity are considered to be acts of academic dishonesty and include (but are not limited to) cheating, plagiarizing, fabrication, denying other access to information or material and facilitating academic dishonesty, and are subject to the policies and procedures noted in the Student Handbook and within the Course Catalog, including the Student Code of Conduct and the Student Judicial System. Please note that lack of knowledge of citations procedures, for example, is an unacceptable explanation for plagiarism, as is having studied together to produce remarkable similar papers or creative works submitted separately by two students, or recycling work from a previous class.

Please review [NYU's School of Engineering's academic dishonesty policy](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/academic-integrity-for-students-at-nyu.html) in its entirety. Procedures may include, but are not limited to: failing the assignment, failing the course, going in front of an academic judicial council and possible suspension from school. Violations will not be tolerated.

All work for this class must be your own and specific to this semester. Any work recycled from other classes or from another, non-original source will be rejected with serious implications for the student. Plagiarism, knowingly representing the words or ideas of another as one’s own work in any academic exercise, is absolutely unacceptable. Any student who commits plagiarism must re-do the assignment for a grade no higher than a D. In fact, a D is the highest possible course grade for any student who commits plagiarism.

This includes copying code for other sources, using code from other sources with only slight modifications and using code from other sources without a reference.

### A Special Note On LLMs and Large Diffusion Models

This is a class about creative uses of technology, and LLMs and interfaces like ChatGPT, Midjourney, etc definitely have their place in discussions about technology, society and creativity. Being in the environment we are in, it has become impossible to ignore these tools.

Having said that....

You may use AI interfaces to help generate ideas and images as it pertains to the brainstorming or ideation part of a project and/or to generate images for presentations, as long as proper credit is given.

You may NOT submit any work generated by these interfaces as your own.

Given that this is an introductory course to programming, and we're all starting fresh, I don't believe there is any situation that will warrant the use of these tools for generating code. Save that for a future when you might have to write tedious software for parsing/flipping/transforming database entries. There should be an aura of fun to the code we are writing, and a sense of accomplishment in learning how to make computers do unexpected things, that doesn’t justify the use of tools that generate code.

Likewise, writing/response assignments will be short and personal, asking not only for your understanding of the material, but also your thoughts, interpretations, opinions and concerns about certain topics related to art, design, society and technology. Don’t sell yourself short! I want to hear your voice and words regarding these topics.

### Educational Accessibility Statement

NYU-Tandon is committed to assuring equal educational opportunity and full participation for all students. The mission of the Office for Students with Disabilities is to provide individuals with learning differences (a.ka. disabilities) the same access to programs and activities as other students. We assist students to maximize their potential while helping them develop and maintain independence.
