    1b. (Optional) Setup a GitHub organization for keeping your class project files. This is optional, but will help. Here's a video showing how to do it. Submit your organization name or profile link via Brightspace. (1 point)

    2\. Setup your local development environment with VSCode (or another IDE) and the GitHub Desktop App. Here's a video showing how to setup the GitHub Desktop App. Let me know which IDE you're using and if you are using the GitHub Desktop App (or another git client) via your submission on Brightspace. (1 point)

    3\. Start a repository from the class template in your personal or organization GitHub account. It should be named HW01. Here's a video showing how to do this. Submit the link to this repo via Brightspace. (2 points)

    Please submit your response via Brightspace submission.

    Your response should be personal, meaning that you should be expressing your views and opinions about the text and not just summarizing it. You can use the following rubric to guide your response:

    - Short summary: In 1 phrase, what is it about? Who wrote it? When?
    - Memorable quote: Is there a phrase in the text that stands out or captures the main idea of the text?
    - Did you learn something new? What?
    - What do you agree or disagree with? Why?
    - How is this text related to programming?
    - If you were to continue reading the book which chapter or command do you think would resonate the strongest with you?
    - If you were to look up another thinker/author, were there any references in the text that intrigued you?
