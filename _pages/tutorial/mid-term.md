<h2 class="week-title">{{ page.title }}</h2>

This is going to be a wild tutorial.

In addition to the new concept of ```Class```, we're also going to use pretty much all of the things we've learned so far:

- loops
- functions
- arrays
- state variables
- mouse events
- pseudo-code
- animations
- drawings

Let's get started.
