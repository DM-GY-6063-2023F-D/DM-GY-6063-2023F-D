# Class Setup

## Sketch Notebook

Like... a physical notebook with paper and some pens. This will be needed for notes, sketches and drawings during class and for sketching out ideas and prototypes for projects and assignments. If you're already using a digital notebook app on a tablet... that's also fine.

## Git and Github

Sign-up for a free [github](https://github.com) account. Pick a username, add your name to your profile, send me a link to your profile ([video]()).

I recommend creating an organization for keeping this course's materials separate from other repositories or materials you might want to add to your account ([video]()).

Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). This is the easiest way to install and setup git, specially on Windows computers ([video]()). (Feel free to skip this if you already have git installed and you are comfortable using the command line interface).

## Arduino IDE

We'll be using the official Arduino IDE. It can be sownloaded [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

## p5js IDE

We'll be using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) from Microsoft with the following extensions:

- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
- [p5js Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=acidic9.p5js-snippets)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

Feel free to use other IDEs/text editors. I like VSCode because it makes it easy to work with git and start a local server to preview p5js and web projects.

## p5js Template Repo

Use our [p5js template](https://github.com/DM-GY-6063-2023F-D/p5js-template) to start any p5js assignment/project repositories ([video]()).
