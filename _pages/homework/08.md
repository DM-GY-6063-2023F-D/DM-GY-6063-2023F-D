    This response will be different! After you read the text, ask ChatGPT to write a 200-word response using prompts that get it to cover some of the rubric we've been using:

    - Short summary: in one phrase, what is the book about?
    - Memorable quote: Is there a phrase in the text that stands out or captures its main idea?
