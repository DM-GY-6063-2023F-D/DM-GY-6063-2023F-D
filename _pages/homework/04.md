    This assignment ...

    Each of these projects should also have a ```README.md``` file with a brief documentation of your thought process, sketches and things that you tried, but didn't work, etc. The writeup will help me follow your thought process when grading, so the more info you give me, the better I can evaluate your submission. You can use the following rubric to guide your writeup:

    - Summary of the project: in 1 sentence, what is the project about?
    - Plan of execution: what was your plan for doing the assignment? What were the shapes you had to draw?
    - How did you actually implement the drawings? Which shapes did you draw?
    - What was the hardest part? What was the most fun part?
    - Optional: Include a drawing or diagram of how you split up the more complex shapes into simpler shapes.
    - Optional: Any other images of drawings or physical sketches?

    HW04A. The Digital Interactive Cubist Abstract Expressionist (5 points):  
    Using the ```if()``` command and p5.js variables for [detecting mouse interactions](https://p5js.org/reference/#EventsMouse), create an interactive piece that draws something different every time there's a mouse click or movement. What shapes to draw is up to you: they can be simple ```rect()``` of different proportions, ```line()``` of varying widths or even ```arcs()``` and [```bezier()```](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/bezier) curves with ```random()``` parameters. Their location should be related to the mouse location on the canvas (if possible), and their colors and other parameters should always be different. You can use just one shape for the whole exercise (as long as the parameters are always different) or you can vary the shape with each click.

    For full credit, write about your choices in the ```README``` file in your repository. How many shapes are you using? Are you drawing when the mouse is pressed or when the mouse is moved?

    HW04A:  
    Other than [```mouseIsPressed```](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/mouseIsPressed), other variables that are fun to use are: [```mouseX```](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/mouseX) and [```mouseY```](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/mouseY), [```pmouseX```](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/pmouseX) and [```pmouseY```](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/pmouseY), and [```movedX```](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/movedX) and [```movedY```](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/movedY).

    Like HW03C, knowing how to get random numbers within a specific range will go a long way for this one.

    Since we have to keep all the drawn shapes on screen between frames we can't call ```background()``` in the ```draw()``` function, but Wehave to put it in ```setup()```.

    Also, ```mouseIsPressed``` can be a little over-sensitive and fire many times with one click. That Happens when our ```draw()``` function is running too fast, and even for the quickest mouse clicks it is able to run multiple times while our finger is pressing the button. We'll see how to properly fix this in our next class, but for now we can experiment changing the frame rate (how often it runs ```draw()```) by calling [```frameRate()```](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/frameRate) during ```setup()```. Something like ```frameRate(40)``` or ```frameRate(30)``` should still feel responsive and avoid too many spurious clicks.

    And, if we want to vary the shape with each click, one way to do that is to keep a variable that counts the number of clicks and then we can pick the next shape to be drawn based on whether that number is odd/even, or a multiple of 10, or larger than 50...

  title: What is interaction?
  intro: |
    Keep this question in mind while you read this week's texts and write your 200-word response to:
  description: |
    As always, your response should be personal, meaning that you should be expressing your views and opinions about the text and not just summarizing it. You can use the following rubric to guide your response:

    - Short summary: in one or two phrases, what are the texts about?
    - Memorable quote: Is there a phrase in either of the texts that stands out or captures the main idea of the texts?
    - Did you learn something new? What?
    - What do you agree or disagree with? Why?
    - How is this text related to programming?
    - Is the text related to any of the other readings we've done so far?
    - If you were to continue reading the book which chapter do you think would resonate the strongest with you?
    - How do these texts relate to each other? What would Chris Crawford say about "The Media Art Pose"?

    Please submit your response via [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/312200).

    Grading for the readings will be assigned following these considerations:

    | Response | Grade|
    | --- | --- |
    | Only summarized the reading | 2 points |
    | Answered some of the prompts, but I can't tell whether<br>you actually read the text, or what you thought | 3 points |
    | Answered enough prompts to express opinions | 5 points |
