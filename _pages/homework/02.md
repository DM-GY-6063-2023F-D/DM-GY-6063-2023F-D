  description: |
    This week's programming assignment will focus on using p5.js drawing functions to get us more familiar with the p5.js coordinate system, color system, shape functions, color functions and overall structure and flow of a p5.js sketch.

    We'll be using p5.js to recreate modernist works of art while focusing on different aspects of their composition and color.

    You'll be turning in 3 sketches. This means you'll be starting 3 projects from the GitHub template. Name them W02A, HW02B, HW02C.

    Each of these projects should also have a ```README.md``` file with a brief documentation of your thought process, sketches and things that you tried, but didn't work, etc. You can use the following rubric to guide your writeup:

    - Summary of the project: in 1 sentence, what is the project about?
    - Plan of execution: what was your plan for doing the assignment? What were the shapes you had to draw?
    - Include a drawing diagram of how you split up the more complex shapes into simpler shapes.
    - Any other images of drawings or physical sketches?
    - How did you actually implement the drawings? Which shapes did you draw?
    - What was the hardest part? What was the most fun part?

    For all of these, you should first create a ```rect``` of similar proportions to the original work to defines the area of the screen where you'll be putting your shapes.

    HW02A. One color, some shapes (1 point):  
    Chose one of the following prints from [Lygia Clark](https://www.moma.org/artists/27445) and recreate it as accurately as possible. The rotated rectangles can be drawn using a couple of [```triangle()```](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/triangle) calls or a [```quad()```](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/quad).

    HW02B. Some colors, crooked shapes (2 points):  
    Chose one of the following paintings from [Kazimir Malevich](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/kazimir-malevich-1561) and recreate it as accurately as possible. Note that some shapes are not only crooked, but also have irregular angles. Look into the [```quad()```](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/quad) function to do something like this.

    </div>

    HW03C. Same, but different (2 points):  
    Create your own composition in the style of [Hélio Oiticica's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hélio_Oiticica) _Metaesquemas_. Using 9 shapes in a square canvas try to recreate the tension of having similar, but slightly different shapes misaligned and overlapping. Instead of using fixed locations for the shape corners, can you think of a way of using [```random()```](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/random) to move their corners slightly?

    </div>

    HW03D. Bonus (2 points):  
    Recreate the following print from [Lygia Clark](https://www.moma.org/artists/27445). Note that you can either compose it from basic shapes like ```rect()``` and ```triangle()``` or create your own custom shape with [```beginShape()```](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/beginShape) and [```endShape()```](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/endShape). For full bonus credits include in your writeup a drawing/diagram of how you split up the shapes.
