  intro: "Read and write a 200-word response to the following:"
  description: |
    As always, your response should be personal, meaning that you should be expressing your views and opinions about the text and not just summarizing it. You can use the following rubric to guide your response:

    - Short summary: in one or two phrases, what is the text about?
    - Memorable quote: Is there a phrase in the text that stands out or captures the main idea of the text?
    - Did you learn something new? What?
    - What do you agree or disagree with? Why?
    - How is this text related to programming?
    - Is the text related to any of the other readings we've done so far?
    - If you were to continue reading the book which chapter do you think would resonate the strongest with you?
    - How is Evan Roth's project related to the text?

    Please submit your response via [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/312200).

    ## Review:
    Our final project is an opportunity to combine everything that we've learned so far to create a piece of work that showcases not only our technical knowledge, but also our design skills, and ability to think critically while making connections between our readings and our practice.

    For full credit projects should have a physical-computing aspect, and a audio or visual aspect, so this means using both an Arduino for input or output, together with a p5js sketch. Projects also have to have custom functions, arrays, objects or classes, ```for()``` loops and ```if()``` statements, and demonstrate forethought and planning. At the same time, we're expected to go beyond the basic concepts of programming, so use of external libraries is extremely encouraged.

    ## This Milestone: project proposal, planning and organizing

    This will be the milestone where you further develop the idea and create a plan for its development.

    Please submit the link to your project repository via [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/312200).

    ## Next Milestones

    ### Milestone 3 (due: 2023/12/13)<br>Working Prototype and Pseudo-code (10 points)
    For this milestone everyone will bring something to share with the class.

    ### Milestone 4 (due: 2023/12/20)<br>In class demo and presentation (30 points)
    This will include a short presentation and demo during class, final code review and a final writeup.
