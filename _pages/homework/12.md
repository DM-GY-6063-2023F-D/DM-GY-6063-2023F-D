  title: Media as environment, or environment as media? How are the natural and the media worlds entangled?
  intro: "Write a 200-word response to the following:"
  description: |
    Feel free to read all of the pages suggested above, or, after reading the Introduction (pages 1 - 13), pick one of the four chapters (chapters 2, 3, 4 or 5) to read.

    Access [Worlds In Figures](https://worldsinfigures.com), watch the tutorial video and play with the software.

    As always, your response should be personal, meaning that you should be expressing your views and opinions about the text and not just summarizing it. You can use the following rubric to guide your response:

    - Short summary: in one or two phrases, what is the text about?
    - Short summary: in one or two phrases, what is Evan Roth's project about?
    - How is Evan Roth's project related to the text?
    - Which chapter did you pick?
    - Memorable quote: Is there a phrase in the text that stands out or captures the main idea of the text?
    - Did you learn something new? What?
    - What do you agree or disagree with? Why?
    - How is this text related to programming?
    - Is the text related to any of the other readings we've done so far?

    Please submit your response via [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/312200).

    Alternatively, you may create a ```reading.md``` file in your HW12 repo and write your response in markdown. Just make sure to submit a link to the file using [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/312200).

    Grading for the readings will be assigned following these considerations:

    | Response | Grade|
    | --- | --- |
    | Only summarized the reading | 1 point |
    | Summarized the reading and project | 2 points |
    | Answered some of the prompts, but I can't tell whether<br>you actually read the text and saw the project | 3 points |
    | Answered enough prompts to express opinions | 5 points |

    ## Review:
    Our final project is an opportunity to combine everything that we've learned to create a piece of work that showcases not only our technical knowledge, but also our design skills, and ability to think critically while making connections between our readings and our practice.

    For full credit projects should have a physical-computing aspect, and an audio or visual aspect, so this means using both an Arduino for input or output, together with a p5js sketch. Projects also have to have custom functions, arrays, objects or classes, ```for()``` loops and ```if()``` statements, and demonstrate forethought and planning. At the same time, we're expected to go beyond the basic concepts of programming, so use of external libraries is extremely encouraged.

    ## This Milestone: project proposal, planning and organizing

    For this week's milestone you will further develop the idea for your project and create a plan for its development.

    !!!HERE!!!

    Please submit the link to your project repository via [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/312200).

    Your writeup must include:
    - System diagram
    - FSM diagram
    - Circuit diagram
    - Description of any external data or library that you are planning to use
    - Reference images, texts and projects
    - Plan for user testing
    - Short discussion of why your project is relevant:
      - how is it related to our readings?
      - how does it connected to society?

    ## Next Milestones

    ### Milestone 3 (due: 2023/12/13)<br>Working Prototype and Pseudo-code (10 points)
    For this milestone everyone will bring something to share with the class.

    ### Milestone 4 (due: 2023/12/20)<br>In class demo and presentation (30 points)
    This will include a short presentation and demo during class, final code review and a final writeup.
