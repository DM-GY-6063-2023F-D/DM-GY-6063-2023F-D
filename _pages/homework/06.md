    You can use the following rubric to guide your response:

    - Short summary: in one or two phrases, what is the video about? When was it made?
    - Memorable quote: Is there a phrase in the video that stands out or captures its main idea?
    - Did you learn something new? What?
    - What do you agree or disagree with? Why?
    - How is this related to programming?
    - Is the video related to any of the other readings we've done so far?
    - If you were to look up another thinker/author, were there any references in the video that intrigued you?

    Please submit your response via [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/312200).

    Alternatively, you may create a ```reading.md``` file in your HW06 repo and write your response in markdown. Just make sure to submit a link to the file using [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/312200).

    ### Milestone 2 (due: 2023/10/18)<br>Pseudo-code, planning and organizing (10 points)
    Continue working on the mid-term project.

    You should have a repository already set up from last week's assignment, and now you are starting to add some code to your sketch.

    By the end of this milestone you should have a pretty solid grasp of the logic that will be required to implement your idea:
    - Is your project split into different moments? or scenes?
    - Which interactive events will you respond to? mouse? keyboard?
    - Do you need any special classes, arrays or objects?
    - What are the custom functions that you'll have to write?

    For full credit, projects should use custom functions, arrays, objects or classes, ```for()``` loops and ```if()``` statements, and demonstrate some amount of forethought and planning.

    Your code won't be finished, but you have started to write it and have implemented some of the shapes or functions that you will use. The rest of your file has placeholders, pseudo-code or simplified versions of your final implementation.

    Include a progress writeup in your README file with:
    - what you've done this week
    - description of the classes, objects or arrays you will use
    - description of any interactivity or time-based logic
    - description of functions you have written or will write

    Please submit the link to your project repository via [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/312200).
