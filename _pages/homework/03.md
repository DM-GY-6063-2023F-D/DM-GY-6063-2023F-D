    Each of these projects should also have a ```README.md``` file with a brief documentation of your thought process, sketches and things that you tried, but didn't work, etc. The writeup will help me follow your thought process when grading, so the more info you give me, the better I can evaluate your submission. You can use the following rubric to guide your writeup:

    - Summary of the project: in 1 sentence, what is the project about?
    - Plan of execution: what was your plan for doing the assignment? What were the shapes you had to draw?
    - How did you actually implement the drawings? Which shapes did you draw?
    - What was the hardest part? What was the most fun part?
    - Optional: Include a drawing or diagram of how you split up the more complex shapes into simpler shapes.
    - Optional: Any other images of drawings or physical sketches?

  title: Is there just one technology? Is there just one way to learn, create or engage with technology?
  intro: |
    Keep these questions in mind while you read this week's text, do a bit of research and write your 200-word response:
  description: |
    While relevant to discussions regarding different reasons to learn to program and media literacy, the first two readings presented very particular points of views modulated by the authors' gender, social positions and geographical locations. Both texts recognize that the world of technology and programming is more plural and "messy" than most people acknowledge, but they fail to explicitly address any issues of social, racial or historical inequalities. So, this week we will take a look at the "messy" worlds of cyberfeminism to get an introduction to other ways of "reading" technology.

    There is a short reading that is a bit more optimistic while giving reasons for being more active in how we think about technology, and then we'll do a bit of research on the [Cyberfeminism Index](https://cyberfeminismindex.com/). Start by reading [about](https://cyberfeminismindex.com/about/) the project, and then, scroll through the index on the main page and select 5 - 10 entries that you find interesting to create your personal Cyberfeminism collection. As you click on entries on the home page a column will pop up on the right side of the screen with your selections. After you've selected 5 - 10 entries you can click on the download button to generate a pdf with your choices.

    As always, your response should be personal, meaning that you should be expressing your views and opinions about the text and not just summarizing it. You can use the following rubric to guide your response:

    - Short summary: in one or two phrases, what is the Glitch Feminism text about?
    - Memorable quote: Is there a phrase in the Glitch Feminism Intro that stands out?
    - Did you learn something new? What?
    - What do you agree or disagree with? Why?
    - How is Glitch Feminism related to programming? or to the other readings we've done so far?
    - Why did you select those entries from the Cyberfeminism Index? It can be a simple reason like: "I'm interested in the latin american perspective on technology", or "I want to learn more about the history of science", or "I'm interested in gender and social equality in technology and society".

    Please submit your response via [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/312200), and attach your Cyberfeminism Index collection pdf.

    Grading for the readings will be assigned following these considerations:

    | Response | Grade|
    | --- | --- |
    | Only summarized the reading | 1 point |
    | Answered some of the prompts, but I can't tell whether<br>you actually read the text, or what you thought | 2 points |
    | Answered enough prompts to express opinions | 3 points |
    | Answered enough prompts to express opinions<br>and included the pdf | 5 points |
