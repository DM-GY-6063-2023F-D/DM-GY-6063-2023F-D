    - Did you learn something new? What?
    - What do you agree or disagree with? Why?
    - How is this text related to programming?
    - Is the text related to any of the other readings we've done so far?
    - If you were to continue reading the book which chapter do you think would resonate the strongest with you?
    - How do these texts relate to each other? What would Chris Crawford say about "The Media Art Pose"?

    Please submit your response via [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/312200).
