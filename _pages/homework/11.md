    ### Password Machine
    This week, we are going to use our Arduinos to create a physical-computing password machine.

    Kind of like the electronic door lock example we saw in class, this will be a machine that keeps track of user inputs and signals *success* if a correct pre-determined sequence of inputs is entered, or *failure* if an incorrect sequence of inputs is entered.

    There are many ways to do this using the analog and digital input functions from the Arduino:
    - Use buttons or switches along with digitalRead() to detect a specific sequence of button presses
    - Use buttons or switches along with digitalRead() to detect a specific combination of buttons that have to be pressed at the same time
    - Use a combination of digitalRead() and analogRead() to detect specific combinations or sequences of buttons presses and potentiometer positions
    - Use some wires or copper tape to turn everyday objects into switches

    ### Requirements:
    - Use at least 3 physical components for inputs (buttons, switches, potentiometers, photocells, bananas)
    - Use 1 output component to signal success: a green, white or blue LED, for example
    - Use a different output component to signal a failure: a yellow, orange or red LED, for example
    - Your password should be secure... so, use at least 3 steps in your sequence.
    - Using ```analogRead()``` is NOT a requirement.

    ### Considerations:
    As an example, a correct password sequence using a potentiometer and 2 buttons could be:
    - Turn potentiometer all the way to the left
    - Press button 1
    - Turn potentiometer all the way to the right
    - Press button 0
    - Turn potentiometer to the middle
    - Press button 1
    - Press button 0

    This password sequence has 7 steps and is more than what's expected for this assignment.

    It's easier to use fixed-length sequences. What this means is that the system only reports if a sequence is correct after a fixed number of steps has been taken, then it reports success or failure and resets.

    In the case of the example above, it would wait until there are 4 button presses and only then turn on either a red or green light.

    ### Submission and Grading:
    There's no template to clone for this one. We'll just start a project named HW11 through the Arduino IDE and then push its folder to our GitHub account (like in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuhrHrkvV0E)).

    Include a README with:
    - Drawing of the Finite State Machine for your password.
    - Description of your logic and the correct steps necessary for a successful sequence.
    - A schematic drawing of your circuit.

    Use [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/312200) to submit a link to your repository and a video of your project working. The video should show a correct sequence of steps and an incorrect sequence. You can upload the file to Brightspace or host it somewhere else and submit a link.

    The following guide will be used for grading:

    | Task | Points |
    | --- | --- |
    | README file with circuit diagram | 2 points |
    | FSM diagram | 2 points |
    | Follow assignment instructions | 2 points |
    | Implementation | 2 points |
    | Thoughtfulness | 2 points |
    | Craft | 2 points |

    Implementation: work shows evidence of understanding programming concepts and you are fully using them to express your ideas.

    Thoughtfulness: project demonstrates your personality and it's not a straightforward re-implementation of someone else's idea.

    Craft: code and results show care and consideration for presentation and professionalism, and work doesn't look like it was rushed.

  title: What is media archaeology?
  intro: "Keep this question in mind while you read and write a 200-word response to the following:"
  description: |
    The sections to read are:
    - Introduction ETHER/ORE (pg vii)
    - Building Hudson Yards (pg vii)
    - Our Materials of Investigation (pg xxxv)
    - Waves and Wires CITIES OF ELECTRIC SOUND (pg 1)

    As always, your response should be personal, meaning that you should be expressing your views and opinions about the text and not just summarizing it. You can use the following rubric to guide your response:

    - Short summary: in one or two phrases, what is the book about?
    - Memorable quote: Is there a phrase that stands out?
    - Did you learn something new? What?
    - What do you agree or disagree with? Why?
    - Did the text remind you of any other texts we've read so far?
    - How is the text related to programming?
    - Was there anything in the text that surprised you? What? Why?

    Please submit your response via [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/312200).

    Alternatively, you may create a ```reading.md``` file in your HW11 repo and write your response in markdown. Just make sure to submit a link to the file using [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/312200).

    Grading for the readings will be assigned following these considerations:

    | Response | Grade|
    | --- | --- |
    | Only summarized the reading | 2 points |
    | Answered some of the prompts, but I can't tell whether<br>you actually read the text, or what you thought | 3 points |
    | Answered enough prompts to express opinions | 5 points |

    ## Description:
    Our final project is meant to .... give us an opportunity to combine everything that we've learned so far to create a piece of work that showcases not only our technical knowledge, but also our design skills, and ability to think critically while making connections between our readings and our practice.

    For this project you are going to design an interactive or time-based book cover.

    For full credit projects should use custom functions, arrays, objects or classes, ```for()``` loops and ```if()``` statements, and demonstrate forethought and planning.

    ## Dates, milestones, submissions
    The project will be due on 2023/XX/XX. You have four weeks to work on it, but there are weekly milestones that have to be submitted for grading. You should not wait until the last week to start programming. You should start programming and experimenting with ideas as soon as you have an idea that you are happy with.

    ### Milestone 1 (due: 2023/MM/DD)<br>Project proposal (10 points)
    Think about experiments and ideas that you might like to explore. Draw and sketch some possibilities on paper/tablet. Clone [our template](https://github.com/DM-GY-6063-2023F-D/p5js-template) and write about all of these things on the ```README.md``` file:
    - What book did you choose? What is it about?
    - What aspect of the book will you include in your cover?
    - Is it interactive? time-based? both?
    - What ideas would you like to explore or experiment with?
    - Are there aspects of your project that are related to any of the readings we've done?
    - Include at least one drawing or sketch

    Please submit the link to your project repository via [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/312200).

    ### Milestone 2 (due: 2023/MM/DD)<br>Pseudo-code, planning and organizing (10 points)
    More details next week, but by this milestone you should have a pretty solid grasp of the logic that will be required to implement your idea. Your code won't be finished, but you have placeholders or simplified versions of your final design. Progress writeup.

    ### Milestone 3 (due: 2023/MM/DD)<br>In class demo and presentation (30 points)
    More details next week, but this will include a short presentation and demo during class, final code review and a final writeup.
