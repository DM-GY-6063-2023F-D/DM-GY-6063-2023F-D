    ### Password Machine

    This week, we are going to use our Arduinos to create a physical-computing password machine.

    Description...

    There are many ways to do this using the analog and digital input functions from the Arduino:
    - 1
    - 2
    - 3

    ### Requirements:
    - NUM INPUTS
    - LIGHTS
    - Make it personal. Make it interesting.
    - Using ```analogRead()``` is NOT a requirement.

    ### Tips:

    TIPS HERE

    ### Submission and Grading:
    There's no template to clone for this one. We'll just start a project named HW11 through the Arduino IDE and then push its folder to our GitHub account (like in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuhrHrkvV0E)).

    Include a README with:
    - Description of your logic and the correct steps necessary to pass.
    - A schematic drawing of your circuit.

    Use [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/312200) to submit a link to your repository and a video of your project working. The video should show a correct sequence of steps and an incorrect sequence. You can upload the file to Brightspace or host it somewhere else and submit a link.

    The following guide will be used for grading:

    | Task | Points |
    | --- | --- |
    | README file with diagram | 2 points |
    | Follow assignment instructions | 2 points |
    | Implementation | 2 points |
    | Thoughtfulness | 2 points |
    | Craft | 2 points |

    Implementation: work shows evidence of understanding programming concepts and you are fully using them to express your ideas.

    Thoughtfulness: project demonstrates your personality and it's not a straightforward re-implementation of someone else's idea.

    Craft: code and results show care and consideration for presentation and professionalism, and work doesn't look like it was rushed.

  title: What is media archaeology?
  intro: "Keep this question in mind while you read and write a 200-word response to the following:"
  description: |
    The sections to read are:
    - Introduction ETHER/ORE (pg vii)
    - Building Hudson Yards (pg vii)
    - Our Materials of Investigation (pg xxxv)
    - Waves and Wires CITIES OF ELECTRIC SOUND (pg 1)

    As always, your response should be personal, meaning that you should be expressing your views and opinions about the text and not just summarizing it. You can use the following rubric to guide your response:

    - Short summary: in one or two phrases, what is the book about?
    - Memorable quote: Is there a phrase that stands out?
    - Did you learn something new? What?
    - What do you agree or disagree with? Why?
    - Did the text remind you of any other texts we've read so far?
    - How is the text related to programming?
    - Was there anything in the text that surprised you? What? Why?

    Please submit your response via [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/312200).

    Alternatively, you may create a ```reading.md``` file in your HW11 repo and write your response in markdown. Just make sure to submit a link to the file using [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/312200).

    Grading for the readings will be assigned following these considerations:

    | Response | Grade|
    | --- | --- |
    | Only summarized the reading | 2 points |
    | Answered some of the prompts, but I can't tell whether<br>you actually read the text, or what you thought | 3 points |
    | Answered enough prompts to express opinions | 5 points |
